    <section id="About">
        <p>My name is Kavin Chaudhary and I am 11 years old. I sing and play guitar. I live in New Delhi which is in India. I live with my parents, grandparents and sister. My favorite season is Spring because it is the time when flowers and plants bloom and all of nature is happy. I don't have a favourite book because I'm a bookworm and read so many books that I can't compare them.</p>

            <p>I go to D.P.S. R.K.Puram and I am in 6th grade(currently). My favourite holiday is, well... any of them. My hobby is fidgeting. Yes, that counts! I literally pick up something and play with it. I even play with my fingers and toes. </p>

            <p>Beauty of All</p>
            <p>There are many places you may not have visited but all are beautiful. All are beautiful in their unique ways. Everyone may not like a certain place but all are beautiful if you look in the right perspective. Take Delhi and Sikkim for example.

                Both of these places have beautiful sceneries but they are both very different. Where you see beautiful tea gardens in Sikkim you see the marvelous urban jungle in Delhi. In Delhi, many languages are spoken but Hindi and English spoken more. In Sikkim, Nepali is spoken more than other languages but they are spoken. Both Delhi and Sikkim have UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Delhi has Humayun’s Tomb, Sundar Nursery, Qutub Minar and Red Fort. On the other hand, Sikkim has Khangchendzonga National Park. Sikkim is famous for it’s sceneries, mask dances, festivals and is also called The Switzerland of India. It is also famous for the tallest mountain in India, Khangchendzonga. Whereas Delhi is famous for its monuments, diversity and its size. Delhi is known for its famous market, Connaught Place. Despite being the second smallest state in India, Sikkim holds more than 6.190 lakh people. If you think that’s a big number then check out Delhi’s population, it is around 1.1 crore people. Did you know that Sikkim is the first state in the world to do completely organic farming. There is a ban on the use of pesticides and fertilizers in Sikkim. Sikkim is India’s largest cardamom producer.

                Now when these places are compared, you don’t know which one is better so you visit them. Afterwards, your opinions are yours because some may think differently than you. You may be surprised that you can’t figure out your decision at all! I would like to end with a few lines:
                “Delhi and Sikkim,
                Fascinating wonderlands,
                Both are renowned,
                Both adorned.
                Lands of charming greeneries
                Beautified with sceneries.”
            </p>
            <p>Gratitude</p>
            <p>
                O dreadful disease
                From where have you stepped in
                Gave trouble to young and old
                Thou we were bold
                But no one is left without your impact
                We give our heartiest respect
                To those doctors and nurses and Police and Social Workers
                The society’s real heroes
                Who tried their best to remove our woes
            </p>
